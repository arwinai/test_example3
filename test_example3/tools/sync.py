"""Sync ALL local CAD binaries to the Azure `assets` container in one shot.

Mirrors every *.FCStd / *.SLDPRT / *.SLDASM / *.STEP / *.step / *.stl /
*.ply found under the task family trees to
https://openaievalsetub0ktk.blob.core.windows.net/assets/<repo-relative-path>:
new files are uploaded and changed files replaced (compared by content
hash, not timestamp). Blobs are deleted only when NO task.toml pins them;
a file that another checkout pinned but this machine lacks is left alone,
both in blob storage and in the toml manifests. It then refreshes the
sha256/bytes pins for the files present here and reports asset files that
have no toml entry yet. Safe to run from a partial checkout.

Requires: az CLI (logged in) and azcopy. Run from anywhere:

    python3 tools/sync.py            # sync + refresh toml pins
    python3 tools/sync.py FreeCAD/4_sling_lift         # sync only that subtree
    python3 tools/sync.py SolidWorks CadQuery/10_living_hinge  # several subtrees

A path-filtered run uploads/replaces/deletes blobs only inside the named
subtrees and refreshes only their task.toml pins; blobs outside the filter
are never touched.
